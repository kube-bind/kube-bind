How does backend operates:

1. `--consumer-scope=cluster` - backend will create a namespace per identity in the consumer cluster. 
2. `--cluster-scoped-isolation` -  {Prefixed,Namespaced,None}


Scenario:
1. Consumer operates on namespaced CRDs - cowboys and cluster-scoped CRDs - sheriffs
2. Backend is set to `consumer-scope=namespaced` and `cluster-scoped-isolation=prefixed`

When binding namespaced CRD - backend will create namespace `kube-bind-<identity>-<consumer-namespace>` in the provider cluster. Objects will be created in that namespace. Same with claims.

When binding cluster-scoped CRD - NOT SUPPORTED. TODO: Add condition on konnector side to tell this is the case.

Scenario:
1. Consumer operates on namespaced CRDs - cowboys and cluster-scoped CRDs - sheriffs
2. Backend is set to `consumer-scope=cluster` and `cluster-scoped-isolation=prefixed`

When binding namespaced CRD - backend will create namespace `kube-bind-<identity>-<consumer-namespace>` in the provider cluster. Objects will be created in that namespace. Same with claims.

When binding cluster-scoped CRD. Oject will be renamed to `kube-bind-<identity>-<original-name>`. 

TODO: There is some issue with permissiong setting up. It required fursther investigation as initial sync fails with permission error.

To make sure claims has right access:
1. If consumer is namespaced - create Role and RoleBinding in the consumer namespace. Watch APIServiceNamespaces for this.
2. If consumer is cluster-scoped - create ClusterRole and ClusterRoleBinding based on APISericeExport spec.
