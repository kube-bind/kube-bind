# kbind

You are invited to [contribute](#contributing)!

## What is it?

kbind (formerly known as kube-bind) provides better support for service providers and consumers that reside in distinct Kubernetes clusters.

- A service provider defines its API in terms of CRDs and associated permission claims/limitations, and exports it for use from other clusters.
- Service consumers identify the services they want to consume.
- The service CRDs get installed in the service consumer clusters, with objects of the defined kinds written and read by the service consumers.
- The service provider indirectly reads and writes those objects as the interface to the service that it provides.
- The service provider does not inject controllers/operators into the service consumer's cluster.
- A single vendor-neutral, OpenSource agent per consumer cluster connects it with the requested services.

## Try it out

This is the 3 line pitch:

```shell
$ kubectl krew index add bind https://github.com/kube-bind/krew-index.git
$ kubectl krew install bind/bind
$ kubectl bind login https://mangodb
$ kubectl bind
Redirect to the browser to authenticate via OIDC.
BOOM – the MangoDB API is available in the local cluster,
       without anything MangoDB-specific running.
$ kubectl get mangodbs
```

## Technical Overview

<img alt="overview" width="800px" src="./docs/images/overview.png"></img>

All the actions shown between the clusters are done by the konnector, except: the pull at the start is done by the kubectl plugin that installs the konnector.

## Usage

To get familiar with setting up the environment, please check out docs at [kbind.dev](https://docs.kbind.dev/main/setup).

### Limitations

These limitations are part of the roadmap and will be addressed in the future.

* Currently we don't support related resources, like ConfigMaps, Secrets.
* We don't support lifecycle of `BoundSchema` resources, like schema changes.
* The backend currently does not support running with replicas > 1 due to missing external session storage implementation. Session storage is currently in-memory only, which prevents proper session sharing across multiple backend instances.
