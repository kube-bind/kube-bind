      description: |-
        Collection groups multiple APIServiceExportTemplates into a logical group. This functions as a grouping mechanism
        in UIs or CLIs to allow users to select a set of resources to export from provider cluster to consumer cluster.

            APIVersion defines the versioned schema of this representation of an object.
            Servers should convert recognized schemas to the latest internal value, and
            may reject unrecognized values.

            Kind is a string value representing the REST resource this object represents.
            Servers may infer this from the endpoint the client submits requests to.

                      This should be when the underlying condition changed. If that is not known, then using the time when
                      the API field changed is acceptable.

                      Severity provides an explicit classification of Reason code, so the users or machines can immediately
                      understand the current situation and act accordingly.
                      The Severity field MUST be set only when Status=False.

                      Many .condition.type values are consistent across resources like Available, but because arbitrary conditions
                      can be useful (see .node.status.conditions), the ability to deconflict is important.
