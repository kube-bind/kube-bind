          BindableResourcesRequest is sent by the consumer to the service provider
          to indicate which resources the user wants to bind to. It can be sent via
          the HTTP API after authentication, or created directly as a CRD when the
          backend is running without the HTTP API/OIDC flow (frontend disabled mode).

          When created as a CRD, a controller will process the request and create the
          necessary APIServiceExport and related resources.
