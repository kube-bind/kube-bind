# kube-bind Documentation

## Overview

kube-bind is a prototype project that aims to provide better support for service providers and consumers that reside in distinct Kubernetes clusters.

- A service provider defines its API in terms of CRDs and associated permission claims/limitations, and exports it for use from other clusters.
- Service consumers identify the services they want to consume.
- The service CRDs get installed in the service consumer clusters, with objects of the defined kinds written and read by the service consumers.
- The service provider indirectly reads and writes those objects as the interface to the service that it provides.
- The service provider does not inject controllers/operators into the service consumer's cluster.
- A single vendor-neutral, OpenSource agent per consumer cluster connects it with the requested services.
